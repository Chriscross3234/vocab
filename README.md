Welcome to the Vocab Flash Card Program (VFCP) Readme!

I spend some time during 2014 learning how to program with Python. I made it a goal for 2015 to code an actual program that I will use. This readme will serve as a place to store my notes for development of this program.

First Iteration of VFCP outline:
    Have file containing words and paired word definition
        how to seperate words and paired definitions? perhaps maybe using semicolons
        between words and definitions, especially since definitions can contain mutliple 
        sentences and commas.
    VFCP will randomly select a word and it's paired definition
        tricky part, use dictionary?
    VFCP will randomly select three other words
    Display definition and four words, prompt user for correct word
    Prompt user whether correct or incorrect word was chosen
    Retry or Next Word

Nice things to have:
    Play a full game using entire word list without having repeat words
